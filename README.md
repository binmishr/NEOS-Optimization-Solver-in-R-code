# NEOS-Optimization-Solver-in-R-code

NEOS can solve optimization problems with hundreds or thousands of control variables and constraints with so many time-tested algorithms. For more information, you can visit NEOS (https://neos-server.org/neos/). 

To use NEOS service in R, ROI package and its plug in packages are needed. As we use ROI and ROI.plugin.neos package, install these packages in R studio. 


Point To Note 

ROI provides too many functionalities to be covered in this post. It, also, has many plug-in packages as you can see the plug-in list from the above figure, Therefore this post deal with small part of it. 

As our focus centers mainly on portfolio optimization or asset allocation. we consider a quadratic optimization problem. 

The codeset is attached in the .docx file with this repository.
